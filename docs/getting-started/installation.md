# Installing PyneCore

This guide will walk you through the process of installing PyneCore on your system.

## System Requirements

Before installing PyneCore, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python Version**: 3.11 or newer (as specified in the project's requirements)
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Required Dependencies**: The core system has minimal dependencies, but some features require additional packages

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using pip (Recommended)

The simplest way to install PyneCore is using pip:

```bash
# Install without any optional dependencies
pip install pynesys-pynecore
```

This will use no dependencies at all. It only has a dumb CLI.

To install with a user-friendly CLI (recommended):

```bash
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[cli]"
```

To install with additional features, you can specify optional dependencies:

```bash
# Install with built-in data provider capabilities
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[providers]"

# Install with specific provider support
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[ccxt]"
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[capitalcom]"

# Install for development
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[dev]"
```

To install with all features without development dependencies:

```bash
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[all]"
```

If you want to install all features with development dependencies:

```bash
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[all,dev]"
```

### Method 2: From Source (for developers)

For developers who want the latest development version or plan to contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PyneSys/pynecore.git

# Change to the PyneCore directory
cd pynecore

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
```

## Setting Up the Working Directory

PyneCore uses a "workdir" directory structure that contains your scripts, data, and configuration. When you run PyneCore, it automatically searches for a "workdir" directory in the current or parent directories.

The working directory structure is organized as follows:

```
workdir/
├── scripts/     # Your Pyne scripts
├── data/        # OHLCV data files
├── output/      # Output files (plots, strategy results)
└── config/      # Configuration files
```

PyneCore CLI will automatically create the working directory structure if it doesn't exist.

## Verifying Installation

To verify that PyneCore is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
pyne -h
```

You should see the PyneCore logo and help information for the CLI.

### Creating a Test Script

Create a simple test script to verify everything is working:

```python
# workdir/scripts/test.py
"""
@pyne
"""
from pynecore.lib import script

@script.indicator("Test")
def main():
    print("PyneCore is working!")
```

## Downloading Sample Data

PyneCore includes a data command for downloading historical OHLCV data from various providers. You'll need to install the provider dependencies first:

```bash
pip install "pynesys-pynecore[providers]"
```

To download sample data:

```bash
# List available providers
pyne data download --help

# Example: Download Bybit data (if supported)
pyne data download ccxt --symbol "BYBIT:BTCUSDT:USDT" --timeframe 1D
```
By default, PyneCore will download 1 year of data. You can change this by using the `--from` flag. It can specify a concrete date or if it is just a number, you can specify how many days back you want to download:

```bash
# Download 100 days of data
pyne data download ccxt --symbol "BYBIT:BTCUSDT:USDT" --timeframe 1D --from 100

# Download data from a specific date
pyne data download ccxt --symbol "BYBIT:BTCUSDT:USDT" --timeframe 1D --from 2024-01-01
```

You can also convert your existing CSV or JSON containing OHLCV data to the PyneCore's `.ohlcv` format:

```bash
pyne data convert-from path/to/your/data.csv --symbol "BTCUSDT" --timeframe 1D
```

## Running Your First Script

After installing PyneCore and setting up data, you can run a simple script:

```bash
pyne run test.py data/your-downloaded-data.ohlcv
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have PyneCore installed, you're ready to [create your first script](./first-script.md).
